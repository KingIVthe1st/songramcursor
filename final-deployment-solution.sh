echo "1Ô∏è‚É£  VERIFY LOCAL BUILD (should work perfectly):"
echo "   cd '/Users/ivanjackson/Desktop/music moments'"
echo "   npm install"
echo "   npm run build"
echo ""

echo "2Ô∏è‚É£  COMMIT CURRENT CONFIGURATION:"
echo "   git add ."
echo "   git commit -m 'Final deployment configuration with render.yaml'"
echo "   git push"
echo ""

echo "3Ô∏è‚É£  CREATE NEW SERVICE VIA RENDER DASHBOARD:"
echo "   a) Go to https://dashboard.render.com/"
echo "   b) Click 'New +' ‚Üí 'Blueprint'"
echo "   c) Connect GitHub repository: KingIVthe1st/songgram"
echo "   d) Render will automatically detect render.yaml"
echo "   e) Click 'Apply' to deploy"
echo ""

echo "4Ô∏è‚É£  RENDER.YAML CONFIGURATION WILL SET:"
echo "   ‚úÖ Service Name: music-moments-working"
echo "   ‚úÖ Build Command: npm install && npm run build"
echo "   ‚úÖ Start Command: npm start"
echo "   ‚úÖ Node.js Runtime"
echo "   ‚úÖ Environment Variables: NODE_ENV=production, PORT=10000"
echo "   ‚úÖ Region: Oregon"
echo ""

echo "5Ô∏è‚É£  DEPLOYMENT WILL SUCCEED BECAUSE:"
echo "   ‚úÖ Package.json is in repository root (verified)"
echo "   ‚úÖ No rootDir configuration to cause cache issues"
echo "   ‚úÖ Fresh service with no corrupted cache"
echo "   ‚úÖ Proper Node.js version specified"
echo "   ‚úÖ Clean build process"
echo ""

echo "üéØ WHY THIS WORKS:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Blueprint deployment creates entirely fresh service"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ No cached rootDir settings from old services"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ render.yaml overrides any dashboard settings"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Bypasses all existing service corruption"
echo ""

echo "üöÄ EXPECTED RESULT:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Build will find package.json in /opt/render/project/ (correct location)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ npm install will succeed"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ npm run build will complete successfully"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Application will deploy and run on Render"
echo ""

echo "üìä BACKUP ALTERNATIVES:"
echo "   1. DigitalOcean App Platform (needs GitHub auth setup)"
echo "   2. Vercel (fastest deployment)"
echo "   3. Netlify (good for static sites)"
